      <p class="highlighter">I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal!
        I'm a pickle! What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle!
        W-what are you just staring at me for, bro? I turned myself into a pickle, Morty.
        We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey.
        Jesus Christ! Did the boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books? Well look
        where being smart got you.</p>
      <p>Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist;
        because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something
        about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen
        to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.
        I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value
        in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. </p>
      <p>I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it. Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash!
        "And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle,
        and 9/11 was an inside job?" God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth.
        I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.</p>

      <p class="highlighter">I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's proverbial paradise.
         This isn't Game of Thrones, Morty. Shut the fuck up about moonmen!
         Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.</p>
      <p>It's a dream, Morty! We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we-we all went to sleep.
        Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside Snuffles' dream.
        There is no god, in your face! One dot muthafucka! Ooohhh can do. Puh rum pum pow!</p>
      <p>Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough! Awww, bitch! Pluto's a planet.
        I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?</p>
